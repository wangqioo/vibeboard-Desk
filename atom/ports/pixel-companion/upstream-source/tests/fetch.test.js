// carry -> rest, driven entirely by the rAF loop, so it is easy to get a state
// machine that looks right for one throw and then never settles.
//
// It shipped doing exactly that: the dog dropped the ball at its own feet, was
// back inside the grab radius on the next frame, picked it up, "delivered" it
// without moving, and looped forever at frame rate. Over 72 simulated seconds
// that was 511 phase flips and 254 heart-and-chirp bursts, with the pant timer
// refreshed every frame so the dog never stopped panting. These tests pin the
// shape of one complete fetch and the fact that it ENDS.
