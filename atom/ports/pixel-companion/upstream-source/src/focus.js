//
// The app already had `workMode` - park the pet, hide the butterfly - but it is a
// switch you have to remember to flip, and nobody flips a switch on the way into a
// meeting they are already late for. So the pet never actually knew you were busy,
// and cheerfully meowed a "3 new emails" toast into the middle of a screen-share.
//
// Two rules shape everything here:
//
//   * Held back is NOT thrown away. A notification that arrives while you are busy
//     is queued and delivered as one quiet summary when you are free. Dropping it
//     would make the feature something you switch off after the first missed thing.
//   * Some things must still get through. A calendar nudge is the pet telling you
//     about the meeting you are about to miss - silencing that during the meeting
//     you are currently in is exactly backwards. See DEFERRABLE.
//
// Pure logic on purpose: no Electron, no timers, no I/O. main.js owns the clock and
// the delivery, this file only ever answers questions about the data it is handed,
// which is what makes the whole policy testable without booting an overlay.

// Sources whose messages wait for you. Everything NOT listed here goes straight
// through, which is the safe default: a source nobody has thought about yet is far
// better shown late than silently swallowed.
//
//   email    - the classic interruption, and the whole reason this exists
//   reminder - your own note to yourself; it keeps until you look up
//   bridge   - scripts/agents poking the pet from outside (agent-hook.js)
//   tips     - first-run hints; never urgent by definition
//
// Deliberately absent: `calendar` (time-critical - it is telling you to LEAVE),
// `system` (render-crash and friends: the app reporting it is unwell), and `test`
// (you pressed the button, you want the answer now).
